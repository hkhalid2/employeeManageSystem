# employeeManageSystem
## Description
The main motivation for creating this project was to create an app that allows a manager to generate an HTML file that  displays various cards pertaining to different employees. These cards indicate whether the employee is an Intern, Engineer or the Manager himself as well as displays various other bits of infomation. This app takes user input using the terminal and generates a formatted HTML file using said input. It also has various text files that test the methods and properties of the various classes used in this app so that they are being accessed/used successfully. 

The main problems this app solves include:
* Testing Classes to make sure their properties/methods are working correctly 
* Creating a menu that allows the manager to add as many Interns/Engineers until he sees fit to exit
* Clicking an email address link and already creating an email form addressed to said email using the users default mail platform
* Clicking the Engineer's github link in order to be sent to his github
* Adding various different class types to an HTML document in a manner where their various properties can be seen in a similar sense without overriding the other. 

Overall this project taught me specifically how to write/test various tests using jest, use inquirer in order to obtain user inputted information and how to create/manipulate classes. It also gave me more exposure to various HTML and bootstrap properties I had not used yet. 

## Installation
Node was required to be installed as well as inquirer and jest dependancies.
Inquirer for taking user input in command line while jest was used to test class properties/methods. 
``npm init -y``
``node install -y``
``node install inquirer``
``node install jest``

## Usage
``node index.js``
``npm test``
