# employeeManageSystem
## Description
The main motivation for creating this project was to create a content management system that utilizes a multitude of functions using CLI. These functions included outputting various tables that show departments, roles and employees, adding new members to said catagories and as well as updating a role for a specified employee. This app takes user input using the terminal and manipulates/adds to the company database as specified. . 

The main problems this app solves include:
* Creating a menu that allows the user to add edit/add to the database until he sees fit to exit
* Inputting various new departments, roles and employees into the database.
* Displaying the various departments, roles and employees on the commandline in table format.
* Updating an employees role in the database

Overall this project taught me specifically how to use various queries in SQL to pull from, push from and edit a database. It exposed me to various different joining SQL methods for tables as well as the various different methods for selecting data from said tables in a database. I also got more exposure to inquirer and its various means of recieving information from the commandline.
